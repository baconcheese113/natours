# Natours

Portmanteau of Nature and Tours...a mock website for an excursion company. 
This project was mostly used to learn Sass (scss) and the 7-1 folder approach with partials for a scalable css workflow.
Part of [this](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass) 28-hour Udemy course.

## Installation

To build style.css use

```bash
npm run build:css
```

## Usage

Use any server package to view on localhost.
I use the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) live-server extension by Ritwick Dey [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
